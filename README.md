# my-es6-ui5-app

This project show-cases how to integrate transpiling support for UI5 applications by embedding babel in a custom task via the simple build extensibility concept of the UI5 tooling.

To start the development environment run: 

```bash
npm start
```

The project will be build and the transpiling will take place. Finally a browser will start and open the ```index.html``` page.
